    //We have 4 access modifiers: i)public > ii)protected > iii)default > iv)private

    //public: It means it can be used from the entire project (public library).
    //      There is no restriction to use it.
    //      "public" is one of the "access modifier"s

    //default: It means it is open to a group (Harvard University Library).
    //      If you make something "default" in Java, it will be used just inside the package.

    //      To make something "default" in Java, do not type any access modifier.

    //protected: It means it is open to a group amd their kids (The GYM is open to employees and their kids).
    //      protected is wider than default as it has kids of employees as well.

    //private: it means it is specific for a person (Driving License).
    //      If you make something private, you can use it just while you are in the class.
    //      When you go outside the class it is impossible to use it.

    //When you create something in Java, you should name it.
    //How to name a class: i)Start with upper cases
    //                     ii)If you have multiple words, every word should start with upper cases.
    //                     iii)Other characters should be in lower cases.
    //                     iv)You can use digits in naming.

    //The part between the "{" and "}" is called "Class Body".
